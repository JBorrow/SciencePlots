Deprecated CJK Support
----------------------
CJK Styles have been useful for specific Matplotlib versions.
However, their API has changed and we decided to stop supporting these styles.
See :ghissue:`84`.

.. hint::

    Use other packages that actively maintain CJK fonts,
    e.g. `mplfonts <https://github.com/Clarmy/mplfonts>`_.
